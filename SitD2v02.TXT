               EXT. SOMEWHERE IN VADNAIS HEIGHTS - DAY

               An intense song plays over shots of Jeff's car.  Some driver 
               POV shots.  Some credits. 

               TITLE: SURGERY IN THE DARK 2: The sequel THEY didn’t EXPECT 
               to MAKE!

               The music continues, but the credits end.  The car pulls up 
               near the woods, stops.

               The driver opens his door, begins to exit.

               The passenger does the same.

               The car's trunk opens, the driver stands before it.

               JEFF, bearded, dope, grabs a blunt object from the trunk, 
               hands it to FINN, grabs another for himself.

               They exchange sober looks, nod repeatedly.

               A FAGGOT grins, nods towards Jeff, then Finn. 

               JEFF stands, gazes into the distance.  FINN approaches, stops 
               beside him, gazes likewise, puts his hand on Jeff’s shoulder.

                                     FINN
                         How much time were we gone?

                                     JEFF
                         ...Two weeks.

               Inside the trunk, a heap of old electronics.

               They grab as much of the things as they can hold.

               They carry their blunt objects and electronics towards the 
               woods.

               They walk over a worn bridge of plywood.

               EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

               They toss all the things on the ground

               Again they nod soberly at each other.

               Jeff rolls the largest electronics object into a clearing.  

               His hand picks up a sledgehammer.

               SMASH.  He busts open the electronic device with a mighty 
               blow from the sledge.  

               He smashes it more.

               And more.

               Finn smashes.

               The faggot smashes.

               There are other people here now, who smash as well.

               They smash all together.

               They smash separately.

               The music stops after time enough. 

               They smash rhythmically.

               They smash gaily.

               They smash amidst tomfoolery. 

               Nothing left but debris.

               Another electronic device thrown over the debris.

               The smashing continues.

               No sign of the smashing slowing.

               It goes on.

               Their antics degenerate.

               Hands drop blunt objects. 

               Then smashing.

               Then more dropping. 

               The second object now fully smashed into scattered debris.

               They're no longer truly "smashing" anything.

               Yet they smash. 

               Exhaustion.

               They breathe heavily, wipe their brows.

               Again, they smash at nothing.

               More electronics are tossed on the ground.

               These are smashed. 

               Smashing and tomfoolery.

               They make zany faces.

               They smash what remains of the objects.

               They target the largest remaining bits of debris.

               They reach their limit.  Quiet.  They stand, hunched over in 
               a circle.

               Exhaustion, regret, other mixed emotions on their faces. 

               Jeff wipes his brow, and Finn approaches, puts his hand on 
               Jeff's shoulder.

                                     FINN
                         We shouldn’t have come back.

                                     JEFF
                         We have to go...

               EXT. HILL - SUNSET

               They walk up to a hill, no blunt objects in hand.  They walk 
               up the hill, into the sunset.  “Going Up the Country” maybe 
               plays again, or the other one.  They disappear over the hill, 
               into the sun.

               THE END
