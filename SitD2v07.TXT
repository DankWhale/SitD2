		EXT. A CRACKLING FIRE - NIGHT

		The only thing visible in the darkness is the campfire.

					VOICE (O.S.)
				(ethereal whisper)
			...enough.
				
		The campfire crackles for a few more seconds.

		CUT TO BLACK

		EXT. SOMEWHERE IN TIME - DAY

		An intense song plays over shots of a shoddy white panel van 
		driving, intercut with POV shots from the dash. Credits roll.

		TITLE: SURGERY IN THE DARK 2: TIME ENOUGH FOR SMASHING

		Eventually, the credits end as the van pulls off the road and 
		towards the woods. It stops at--

		THE END OF THE PAVEMENT

		The driver opens his door and steps out.

		Likewise the passenger.

		From the inside of the van, we see the back doors open.

		Before them stand the driver--JEFF--bearded and dope.

		He grabs and slides the sledgehammer out of the van and 
		absentmindedly tosses it to the ground.

		INSERT: The sledgehammer falls to the ground, and with a 
		CRACK, its handle breaks in two.

		Jeff's head swings around to look at the sledgehammer on the 
		ground. He stares intently.

		The sledgehammer stares back.

		A single tear runs down Jeff's cheek.

		FINN, fat and unkempt, walks up to Jeff and puts a firm hand 
		upon his shoulder.

					FINN
			Are you feeling okay, friend?
				
		Jeff gazes up at the sky as a murder of crows flies by.

					JEFF
			I feel... enough.
				
		The two nod soberly at one another.

		A man--ERIC--runs into frame, screaming. Bats strung from 
		his belt loops, and two more in his hands.

		He smashes the already broken sledgehammer repeatedly, with 
		alternating bats and increasing fervor.

		After some smashing, he pants heavily, drops the bats in 
		his hands, and looks up at the others expectantly.

						ERIC
			I'm bat man.
				
		The three exchange tense stares.

		A deer at the edge of the woods stands alert, and then 
		darts off towards the expanse of forest.

		Eric is face down on the pavement, with no bats, mumbling 
		to himself.

						ERIC
					(into ground)
			Fuck you, you suck, fuck you. (etc.)
				
		Jeff stands motionless, eyes wide and darting in all 
		directions.

		Finn, now wearing all Eric's bats, has his arms held straight
		out from his torso. He slowly turns his head to Jeff.

		They nod soberly at one another and each raise a weapon.

		For a frame, the three switch places. Finn on the ground,
		Jeff in Finn's place, and Eric in Jeff's.

		The intense music resumes.

		Finn and Jeff advance on Eric and begin smashing with their 
		blunt instruments of choice.

		Blood sprays everywhere.

		A television with a built-in VCR sitting in the back of the 
		van clicks on to static. It has a tape sticking out.

		Ignoring the violence, we push in on the TV. Eventually we 
		can see that the tape reads "S. GRAHAM".

		As we approach, the tape is sucked into the TV and plays.

		As the image on the TV gains clarity, we push into the screen:

		EXT. WOODED VISTA - DUSK

		"Going Up The Country" is nearing its end as we watch a 
		sunset and the end credits to a film.

		The camera swings around to reveal Finn and Jeff.
				
					FINN
			What WAS that?

					JEFF
			Do you think we lost it?

		They look around nervously.

					FINN
			I don't know, but hopefully we're--
				
		EXT. VAN, THE END OF THE PAVEMENT - DAY

		The scene is not as we left it. Finn and Jeff are dead and 
		bloodied on the pavement. Eric is watching the TV, unharmed.

					FINN (CONT'D)
				(from television)
			--far enough off the beaten path--

		The murder of crows from before flies back, in reverse.
				
					FINN (CONT'D)
				(from television)
			--so as to be away from--
				
		A close up of Eric's eyes.		
				
					FINN (CONT'D)
				(on television)
			--prying eyes.

		Eric smiles to himself.

		The deer from before darts back into the scene in reverse.

		On the TV, Jeff is digging through a backpack.

		EXT. WOODS, CLEARING - NIGHT

		Jeff digs through a backpack. He pulls out a deck of cards.

					JEFF
					(to Finn)
			What does ludology mean to you?

					FINN
			We've no time for games.
				
		The exchange mysterious and meaningful looks.

		CUT TO BLACK

		FADE IN:

		EXT. THE WOODS, CLEARING - DAY

		The TV stands upright on the ground. The screen is blank. The 
		woods are silent.

		A WOUNDED MAN, limps towards the clearing. He is badly hurt
		and bleeding out of his clutched side.

		He is dragging a sledgehammer.

		He is wearing a shirt emblazoned with "I MAKES IT RAIN".

		He reaches the TV and drops his sledgehammer to the ground.

		INSERT: The sledgehammer falls to the ground, and with a 
		CRACK, its handle breaks in two.

		The man's head swings around to look at the broken 
		sledgehammer on the ground.

		The sledgehammer doesn't react.

		The TV starts up with static.

		The man's head swings back around to look at the TV. He drops 
		to his knees before it and stares into the static.

					MAN
			More time...
				
		He looks upwards to the sky. The murder of crows is looping 
		back and forth across the sky.

					MAN (cont'd)
			...I thought I had...
				
		A VHS tape flies across the woods and SMACKS the man in the 
		head. He falls backwards.

		Lying on his back, he lifts the tape to his eyes.

		Written across the tape, written in blood, is "WHALE".

		The man passes out, dropping the tape to his side.

		Eric enters from deep in the woods, walking in reverse, and 
		whistling. He picks up the tape and places it in the VCR.

		He reverse whistles out of the clearing as the tape plays.

		ON SCREEN:

		EXT. A CRACKLING FIRE - NIGHT

		The only thing visible in the darkness is the campfire.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			We shouldn't have come back.

		The TV is thrown into the campfire.

		We enter the television world, as the TV thrown on the fire 
		burns/melts for a few seconds.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Time...
				
		The TV shuts off.

		BLACKNESS

		A slowed-down and distorted version of "Going Up The Country" 
		plays for a few seconds before shutting off with a CLICK.

		Footsteps approaching.

		A lid is opened by Finn. The camera was inside the newly 
		opened thing, pointing upwards.

					FINN
				(turning to look
				at someone off screen)
			Gol' dangit, Jeff. This one didn't
			work, either.

		Finn reaches down next to the camera, and pulls a CD upwards 
		away from the camera.

		INT./EXT. BACK OF VAN, THE END OF THE PAVEMENT - DAY

		Finn is holding a CD with the words "SONGS FROM AND INSPIRED
		BY SURGERY IN THE DANK" in his hands up to Jeff.

					JEFF
			Toss it in the stack, then.
				
		Jeff swings the van door open, revealing a large pile of CDs 
		on the ground outside.

		Finn tosses the disc on the stack, and pulls the door shut.

		As the door SLAMS shut, the screen--

		CUTS TO BLACK
