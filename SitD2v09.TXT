               EXT. CRACKLIN' FIRE - NIGHT

               The only thing visible in the darkness is the campfire.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                              (ethereal whisper)
                         ...Go.

               The campfire crackles for a few more seconds.

               CUT TO BLACK

               Painfully slow opening credits roll over blackness.  Halfway 
               through, a horrible NOISE reminiscent of dial-up fades in, 
               grows louder.  Credits end with the title:

               SURGERY IN THE DARK 2: DOUBLE OR NOTHING

               FADE IN:

               INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

               A dark, candle-lit room.  The walls are adorned with esoteric 
               religious symbols and paintings.  Statues stand scattered 
               around.

               One painting is the word "painting", "pain" in bright red, 
               "ting" in blue.  SCREAMS to the melody of "Going Up the 
               Country" begin.

               They continue as a BEING, heavily cloaked in black robes, 
               stands before a piano.

               The piano is warped and styled to look like a screaming mouth, 
               keys being teeth.

               The being strikes keys, each corresponding to a different 
               screamed note.  The sound becomes darker.  

               The being sings softly to the tune.

                                     BEING
                         I'm gonna tape some killing, I wanna 
                         kiiill my boys...

               Away from the being, in the center of the room, stands an 
               upright sledgehammer.

               The head of the sledge is covered in dried blood. 

               The screams from the piano intensify, halt as the image...

               EXT. SOMEWHERE IN TIME - DAY

               A slow, booming tribal drum beat POUNDS plays over a shoddy 
               white panel van driving, the scenery behind it mainly forest.

               INT. SHODDY VAN - CONTINUOUS

               The expanse of road is seen from the rear.  A flute melody 
               joins the drum beat.

               EXT. SOMEWHERE IN TIME - CONTINUOUS

               The van pulls off the road, towards the woods. It stops at--

               EXT. THE END OF THE PAVEMENT - CONTINUOUS

               The driver opens his door, steps out.

               Likewise the passenger.

               INT. SHODDY VAN - CONTINUOUS

               The back doors open, until a VHS "pause" effect freezes both 
               the screen and drum/flute music.  The screen is "fast 
               fowarded" with VHS distortion, accompanied by an ominous 
               DRONE.  The doors rapidly open fully, revealing JEFF--bearded 
               and dope--for an instant.

               EXT. THE END OF THE PAVEMENT - CONTINUOUS

               The fast forwarding of events alongside the drone persists...

               Jeff grabs the sledge, tosses it on the ground.  FINN, fat 
               and unkempt, walks up to Jeff and puts a firm hand upon his 
               shoulder.  

               A tear runs down Jeff's cheek.

               The two exchange sped-up, unintelligible dialogue. 

               Jeff gazes up.   

               A murder of crows flies by.  The screen pauses, the drone 
               halts.  Seconds later, the screen rewinds, accompanied by a 
               hideous SCRATCHING noise.  The murder of crows fly back in 
               reverse.

               Jeff gazes back down.

               A tear runs up his cheek.

               Finn removes his hand from Jeff's shoulder.  The two nod 
               soberly at each other.

               A gay fag--ERIC--speeds unnaturally into frame, his mouth 
               wide open, unnatural SCREAMS coming out.

               Finn and Jeff stare at him, shake their heads.  Various bats 
               and blunt objects rise from the ground into their hands.  
               They speed towards the woods, Eric remaining in place, his 
               screaming mouth agape.

               Jeff and Finn speed into the woods.

               EXT. THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

               They speed over a crude wooden bridge.

               They speed through a wooded trail, to find...

               EXT. THE WOODS, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

               They unnaturally move to each side of a TV with a built-in 
               VCR in the middle of the clearing, abruptly stop, action 
               returned to normal speed, with no more noise.

               The two stand stiff, staring into space.

               Jeff opens his mouth wide.  It is fixed in place as he speaks.

                                     JEFF
                         What's on TV?

               He closes his mouth.

               Finn opens his mouth and speaks likewise.

                                     FINN
                         It's a re-run.

               Finn bends down, his upper body stiff and unmoving.

               He fumbles for the "on" button, presses it.

               The TV screen turns to static.  An image gains clarity.  We 
               enter the screen...

               EXT. THE END OF THE PAVEMENT - DAY

               Eric is face down on the pavement behind the van, a bloody 
               pool beneath him.  The tribal drum beat fades in, then out, 
               as Eric's body dissolves into a skeleton.

               The TV/VCR from the clearing sits in the back of the van.  
               On the screen is one inhuman purple eye, staring.  It closes.  
               The screen is blank.

               A WOUNDED MAN, his shirt emblazoned with "I Makes It Rain", 
               stumbles out of the forest, clutching a bloody wound on his 
               side, dragging the sledge in his other hand.

               The man limps to the skeleton, kneels, drops the sledge.

               The sledge hits the pavement.  Its handle breaks in two. 

               The eye from the TV shoots back open.

               The POV is now from the cracked sledgehammer, a diagonal 
               crack over the entire field of view.  Everything on the left 
               side slowly turns a shade of red, everything on the right to 
               a shade of blue.  The wounded man is in the left corner.  He 
               lifts the skeleton, drags it towards toward the woods, out 
               of sight.  Two men exit the van, sporting ancient-looking 
               clothes adorned with esoteric symbolism, one primarily in 
               red, resembling Jeff, and the other in blue, resembling Finn.  
               RED JEFF holds a golf club, BLUE FINN a bat.  They exchange 
               a nod and evil looks, head towards the woods out of view.

               EXT. WOODEN FORT - DAY

               The wounded man struggles toward a small fort made of boards 
               with the skeleton, still bleeding.

               He collapses in front of it.  He winces, cries out, clutches 
               his side.  He pushes the skeleton through the fort opening, 
               his arm shaking.  He manages to get it inside.  His face 
               falls into the dirt.

               The skeleton inside is in an upright sitting position.

               The dead body dissolves into a second skeleton.  Sounds of 
               rummaging through the forest grow louder, joined by distorted 
               laughter.  

               Red Jeff and Blue Finn appear nearby, scout the area.  Blue 
               Finn points to the fort.  They spew distorted laughs, scurry 
               closer to it.  Red Jeff picks up the wounded man's skeleton, 
               throws it away.

               It lands in a bog.

               Red Jeff and Blue Finn stand in front of the fort, gaze at 
               each other with twisted grins.

               A distorted version of the flute melody plays as Eric's 
               skeleton dissolves into Eric.  Eric sees the men ahead of 
               him, starts bawling.

               Red Jeff and Blue Finn unleash two horrible distorted cackles, 
               enter the fort.  Eric's bawling intensifies.

               EXT. THE WOODS, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

               The clearing is calm, but Eric's wails echo through the 
               forest.

               An identical TV/VCR sits in the middle of the clearing.  

               A tape labeled "WHALE" sticks out of it.  The tape inserts 
               itself fully.

               On the screen, static appears, with flashes of an eye, then 
               an image gains clarity.

               We enter this screen... 

               EXT. WOODED VISTA - DUSK

               A flute version of "Going Up The Country" fades out as the 
               sun disappears over a hill.

               On the reverse side of the vista sit Finn and Jeff.

                                     FINN
                         What WERE those?

                                     JEFF
                         Do you think we lost them?

               They look around nervously.

                                     FINN
                         I don't know.  But we might be--

               INT. SHODDY VAN - DAY

               A man resembling Eric, dressed in purple clothes in the style 
               of Red Jeff/Blue Finn, squats in the back of the van, watches 
               the TV, where the vista scene is seen.

                                     FINN
                              (from television)
                         --far enough off the beaten path--

               EXT. THE END OF THE PAVEMENT - CONTINUOUS

               The van is seen again from the sledge's cracked POV, but 
               each side is now bright red/blue.

                                     FINN (O.S.)
                              (from television)
                         --as to be away from--

               INT. SHODDY VAN - CONTINUOUS

               A close up of Purple Eric's eyes, each colored purple.

                                     FINN (O.S.)
                              (from television)
                         --prying eyes.

               Eric smiles, lets out a distorted chuckle.

               On the TV, Jeff digs through a backpack.

               EXT. WOODED VISTA - NIGHT

               Jeff pulls out a pair of dice from the backpack.

                                     JEFF
                              (to Finn)
                         Do you believe in doppelgangers?

                                     FINN
                         We've no time for double games.

               They exchange serious looks.

               Jeff's rolls the dice.

               They land on snake eyes.

               Finn's right eye widens.

               Jeff's left eye does the same.

                         We shouldn't have come back.

               The TV is thrown into the campfire while turned on.  It begins 
               to melt/burn.  The screen image flickers between static, a 
               screaming mouth, the fort, the sledge POV, and an eye.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                              (ethereal whisper)
                         I have to--

               The TV screen SHATTERS from an apparent sledge blow.  A blue 
               haze emanates from its remnants.

               A melted tape burns in the flames.  It is labeled "BAT MAN".

               A fast forward effect grips the scene of the burning TV.  A 
               rewind follows, then quick alteration between the two.  A 
               SCREAM.  The scene pauses.  A tape ejection is heard, and 
               we...

               CUT TO BLACK

               Faint SCREAMS to the tune of the flute melody grow louder.

                         inside...

               Faint SMASHING noises akin to the tribal drum beat accompany 
               the screams, before both screams and smashing fade out.
