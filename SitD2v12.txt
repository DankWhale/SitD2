     INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY

     JEFF, wearing a chef's hat and green glasses sits on a couch
     with FINN, a big fat guy in sweats. They are watching TV.

                          JEFF
               What's on TV?

                          FINN
               It's a re-run.

                          JEFF
               How many times did it run?

                          FINN
               Times enough! We gotta get this
               darn antenna fixed!

     He gestures to the antenna, which is quite mangled, taped
     together, and obviously in need of repair. Jeff stands up.

                          JEFF
               Looks fine to me! Now, if you'll
               excuse me, I've got to go bake my
               souffle for the big contest!

     Jeff exits stage right into the kitchen. Finn stands up and
     fiddles with the antenna. He looks at the TV. We enter the TV

     ON TELEVISION - TIMELESS

     We see a blue void. Falsetto singers grace the soundwaves.
     The silhouette of a fat naked guy fades into view in the
     center. He is standing before a PURPLE TV, waggling his dick
     around, and he starts grunting.

     A RED SILHOUETTE slides in from the side. It is thin, also
     naked, and wearing a chef's hat. He has a much larger dick,
     and is wiggling it and grunting in a similar fashion.

     Eventually, as this new figure slides across the screen
     grunting, his grunts and the other grunts join together with
     the falsetto voices in a majestic harmony.

     We push in on the purple TV screen, and once it fills the
     entire screen, a title fades in:

                          SURGERY IN THE DARK 2

                          VOICE (O.S.)
               Surgery in the Dark 2 was filmed
               before a live studio audience!

                                                      FADE IN:


     INT. DEN - NIGHT

     A GHOULISH LOOKING MAN in black robes sits in an easy chair,
     with a book on his lap, puffing on a corncob pipe.

                          MAN
               Hello, and welcome to Surgery in
               the Dark 2. Tonight, we have a very
               special treat. Episode 12: "The
               Practitioners of Fate". One of my
               personal favorites. Let's see if we
               can save our boys, this time.

     He closes the book, and the screen fades to black with "THE
     PRACTITIONERS OF FATE" in a ghoulish white font.


     INT. SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Finn is still fiddling with the antenna. DING-DONG. The
     doorbell rings, startling Finn.

     Jeff leans out of the kitchen.

                          JEFF
               Can you get that!? I'm sort of in
               the middle of something in here!

     The door closes. Finn walks over to the front door. Opens it.

     A bearded CABLE GUY in a purple polo stands outside with a
     clipboard.

                          CABLE GUY
               Hey there! I'm from PurpleCord
               cable services, and I'm here to fix
               your cable!

                          FINN
               I didn't order any--

                          CABLE GUY
               They sent me here to save you
               boys...

     An ominous CRACK of lightning across an otherwise perfectly
     blue sky.

                          CABLE GUY (CONT'D)
               ...from your cable problem.

     The cable guy pushes past Finn and walks over to the TV.

                          CABLE GUY (CONT'D)
               This the TV with the problem?

     Jeff leans into the room from the kitchen.

                          JEFF
               Yes, that's the one. Now please do
               be quiet! I'm baking a souffle for
               the mayor!

     He dips back into the kitchen.

     The cable guy is looking at the TV.

     ON TV:

     A man stands alone in a white void. His mouth is fully-agape,
     and we are slowly pushing into his silently screaming mouth.

     There is a crackling speaker system relaying a message.

                          SPEAKERS (O.S.)
               TWELVE! TWELVE! TWELVE! TWELVE!
               TWELVE! TWELVE! TWELVE! TWELVE!

     IN ROOM:

                          CABLE GUY
               Yeah, that doesn't look good. Let
               me get to work.

     He goes around to the back of the television set, opens it
     up, and starts fiddling around with knobs.

     Finn continues watching the TV.

     ON SCREEN: INT. SHODDY VAN - DAY

     In the back of the van, there are no seats. Only a lone tire.

     Inside this tire is a bubbling mucky brown void.

     Out of this void rises a face, staring directly into the
     camera.

     It looks eerily-similar to the cable guy, but with one red
     eye, and one blue eye.

     OUTSIDE THE TV:

     Finn is shook. He hurries off to the kitchen.


     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Jeff is busy mixing a bowl of goo, checking the oven, and
     reading a cookbook all at once.

                          FINN
               Jeff! The cable guy is... in the
               TV.

     Jeff looks up from his tasks.

                          JEFF
               Uh, yeah, Finn. Isn't that his job?

     Finn opens his mouth to elaborate.

                          JEFF (CONT'D)
               Now would you PLEASE BE QUIET!?

     DING-DONG! The doorbell rings again.

                          JEFF (CONT'D)
               Oh my! Can you get that, and BE
               QUIET about it!

     Finn rushes out of the kitchen to go get the front door.


     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

     The cable guy is at the front door talking to a little twink
     wearing a green halter top. The twink is named ERIC and he's
     holding an empty coffee mug. He notices Finn.

                          ERIC
                    (at Finn)
               Oh, yoohoo!! I've been working on
               my submission for the contest, and
               I've run out of mallows! Could you
               spare some MALLOWS for a neighbor!?

     He notices the TV, and walks past the cable guy over to it.

                          ERIC (CONT'D)
               WHAT are you watching?! Lol.

     ON TV:

     A bubbling foamy mudpit boils and bubbles. There is a
     sledgehammer floating in it, that is somehow perfectly clean,
     save for a purple handprint on the handle.

     LOUD, HORRIBLE, INCESSANT, REPETITIVE crow caws are heard.

     IN ROOM:

     Eric is sitting directly in the glow of the TV, transfixed by
     the CROW NOISES, which are continuing and even GROWING LOUDER

                          JEFF (O.C.)
               Oh, DO BE QUIET NOW!!!

     A rain of mallows begins to smack Eric in the face
     repeatedly. Jeff is tossing them from the kitchen doorway.

     After a bit of this, Jeff returns to the kitchen, and Eric
     takes notice of the mallows. He fills his mug and stands.

                          ERIC
                    (yelling)
               OKAY THANKS JEFF, I'LL BE ON MY WAY
               NOW, HA HA! THANKS AGAIN!

     He walks over to the door, which is being held open by Finn.
     He nods and steps outside, slipping on a loose door mat.

     CRACK! His skull hits the ground and there is a SPLATTER of
     blood back into the house. Finn SLAMS the door shut.

     Across the room, the cable guy stands up from behind the TV.

                          CABLE GUY
               Welp, you should be good to go!

     Jeff exits the kitchen carrying a beautiful souffle.

                          JEFF
               Oh, how WON-derful! Just in time.

     The three of them converge on the couch. Jeff sets down the
     souffle and sits, Finn sits as well, and the cable guy sits
     between the two of them. They stare into the TV.

     The nonconcordant chimes of bells, crows cawing, mud slopping
     around, and the smashing of electronics coming from the TV
     grows louder and more intense, as the light around them dims,
     and is replaced with only the rotating and morphing
     red/purple/blue glow from the TV shining on their faces.

     The cable guy's eyes swirl into different colors. One red,
     one blue. On his face, a grin grows wide.

                          JEFF
               It's a re-run.

                          FINN
               How many times has it run?

                          JEFF
               It ran and ran, but couldn't out-
               run.

                          FINN
               Times enough, then?

                          JEFF
               Times enough, indeed.

                          CABLE GUY
               It couldn't run off of the beaten
               path, for it is the beaten path
               which beats us all.

                          ALL TOGETHER
               Amen.

     GLITCH TO BLACK
