               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - EVENING

               A pair of double doors swing open as a stretcher bursts 
               through, a couple NURSES and a DOCTOR pushing behind it.  A 
               little twink, ERIC, lies motionless on the stretcher, his 
               head a bleeding mess.  They run with the stretcher down the 
               hall, avoiding other staff.

                                     DOCTOR
                         We got a bloody twink here!

                                     NURSE 1
                         How much time do we have, doctor? 

                                     DOCTOR
                         Time enough.  We're gonna save this 
                         boy!

               INT. OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The door bursts open with the stretcher.  The doctor and 
               nurses join some other hospital personnel in the room and 
               gear up with gloves and masks, etc.

               The doctor harshly tosses Eric onto an operating table, looks 
               toward the other staff.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Alright, what are we doin'?

               A male nurse does an exaggerated shrugging gesture. 

               The nurses stand around fidgeting, avoiding eye contact with 
               the doctor.

               Eric coughs violently, spurts blood out of his mouth.  Again 
               he's motionless.

               The doctor winces.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Oooooh, yikes.

                                     NURSE 2
                         Doctor,  I think we should-

                                     DOCTOR
                         Nurse!  Give me 72 ccs of...terror...

               A roar of thunder BOOMS through the hospital.  The doctor 
               holds his hand out towards the nurse, staring intently at 
               Eric.

                                     NURSE 2
                         I...

                                     DOCTOR
                         We're losing him, nurse! 

               The nurses exchange concerned looks.

               A BEARDED GUY wearing purple scrubs opens the door, peaks 
               his head in.

                                     BEARDED GUY
                         Heard there were some equipment 
                         problems.  Everything alright in 
                         here?  

                                     DOCTOR
                              (yelling)
                         YES!  Now would you please BE QUIET?!  
                         I'm saving lives!

               Eric coughs again.  Foam seeps out of his mouth. 

               The bearded guy sees Eric, walks beside the table.  The 
               doctor's hand is still outstretched towards the nurse.

                                     BEARDED GUY
                         Hey now, HEY now.  This looks pretty 
                         serious.

               The guy taps on a TV monitor hanging up above the table.

                                     BEARDED GUY
                         Yep, this baby's busted alright.  
                         I'd better get to work.

               The guy pulls a syringe out of his back pocket, sticks it 
               into the side of the TV, releases fluid into it.

               The doctor's getting pissed.

                                     DOCTOR
                         I thought I told you to be quiet!  
                         NURSE!

               The male nurse steps forward. 

                                     MALE NURSE
                         Yes?

               The doctor waggles his still-outstretched hand.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Sledgehammer?

               A hand puts a sledgehammer into the doctor's.  The doctor 
               pulls the sledge back towards himself, out of view.  He brings 
               his hand back empty.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Golf club?

               The doctor is handed a golf club.  He brings it out view and 
               then his empty hand returns.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Baseball bat?

               He's handed a bat, takes it, and returns his empty hand.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Mallows?

               A rain of mallows fall directly downward onto the doctor's 
               hand.  None of them stay on his hand but the doctor still 
               pulls his hand away and returns it.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Souffle?

               A perfectly baked souffle is handed to the doctor.

               The bearded guy bangs his hand on the side of the TV.  An 
               image of two naked silhouetted men waggling their dicks comes 
               onto the screen, with audio of a falsetto harmony, but it's 
               all distorted and unclear.

               The doctor stands upright, shouts with all his might at the 
               guy.

                                     DOCTOR
                         I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO BE QUIET!

               Another BOOM of thunder.  The power goes out at the hospital.  
               All is pitch black and silent.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...Thank you.  That's much better.

                                     NURSE 1
                         What are we gonna do now, doctor?

                                     MALE NURSE
                              (sobbing)
                         What the hell are we gonna do now, 
                         doctor?

                                     NURSE 2
                         Doctor, what the hell are we gonna-

                                     DOCTOR
                         Nurses?  I want you to listen to me.  
                         Now, I know we've never done anything 
                         like this before but I want you to 
                         trust me.  Now listen, I want you to 
                         trust me here.  What I propose... is 
                         that we do... surgery... in the...

               The room is silent for an uncomfortably long time save for 
               some stifled sobbing.

                                     BEARDED GUY
                         Anyone got like a cell phone, or-

                                     DOCTOR
                         Oh would you PLEASE be QUIET?!

                                     NURSE 1
                         Doctor, surely you don't mean that 
                         we do surgery in the-

                                     DOCTOR
                         Yes, nurse, that's exactly what I 
                         mean.  Now let's get to work.

               A loud electric tool revs up.  It's heard slicing through 
               some sort of material.  A hammer is heard banging on 
               something.

                                     DOCTOR
                         There we go...

               The electric tool stops.  Gross goopy splattering noises.  A 
               machine begins to BEEP.  A handsaw is sawing through 
               something.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Mmmmmkay...

               Sounds of blunt objects smashing a few things, then many 
               different things all at once.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Lovely...

               The smashing and machine beeping continues.  It's joined by 
               a bunch of grunting.  Goofy sounds like a plane flying by 
               and a clown horn honking and a jackhammer and crows cawing 
               intermittently come in.  Eric coughs.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Ope!

               Eric's coughs grow louder.  The smashing sounds get grosser 
               and wetter.  Eric screams horrifically.  He's heard thrashing 
               about on the operating table.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Aaaaand we should be... just about 
                         done here...

               Eric's noises get more guttural and pained until they stop 
               entirely.  The smashing and beeping fades out accordingly.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Perfect!

               The TV monitor flashes on. Its crystal clear picture lights 
               the room.  The doctor and nurses are gathered around it.  
               Eric and the bearded guy are in a gruesome mangled mess 
               together on the operating table.

               ON TV:

               The TV cuts between shots of crows flying, feet running 
               through a forest, and then to a shot of a candlelit room.  
               Strange frowning statues of humans decorate the room.  Bells 
               CHIME from the TV and a FIGURE cloaked in a black robe enters.

                                     FIGURE (V.O.)
                         My boys are safe.

               IN ROOM: 

               The doctor and nurses all stare at the TV, eyes and mouths 
               wide open.

               On the table, Eric's eyes open and glow blue.  The bearded 
               guy's open and glow red, face the TV

                                     BEARDED GUY
                         Never saw this one before.

               The group stares at the TV unmoving.  The TV gets brighter, 
               enveloping the whole room in a purple glow.  A loud DRONING 
               creeps in.  The bell chiming and droning get until they halt 
               as we... 

               CUT TO BLACK
