     The pizza buffet is hospital themed.

     JEFF, wearing a chef's hat and green glasses, sits across a
     booth from FINN, a greasy boy in sweaties.

                          JEFF
               Oh boy I love this restaurant. They
               have the best souffles.

                          FINN
               I'd love it more if the darn TV
               worked!

     Finn gestures up to a large CRT television that is displaying
     static.

                          FINN (CONT’D)
               I'm trying to watch my shows!
               There's a re-run of my favorite
               episode of Pork Fuck and Shitters
               on tonight.

                          JEFF
               How many times has it run?

                          FINN
               Just the one.

     Finn stands up and SMACKS the TV upside the tube.

     A whispy white title card fades in over a wide shot. EPISODE
     14: "14 ENTERS"


     INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

     A pair of double doors swing open as a stretcher bursts
     through, a couple NURSES and a DOCTOR pushing behind it.  A
     little twink, ERIC, lies motionless on the stretcher, his
     head a bleeding mess.  They run with the stretcher down the
     hall, avoiding other staff.

                          DOCTOR
               We got a bloody twink here!

                          NURSE 1
               How much time do we have, doctor?

                          DOCTOR
               Time enough.  We're gonna serve
               this boy!


     INT. PIZZA BUFFET - CONTINUOUS

     The door bursts open with the stretcher.  The doctor and
     nurses rush over to the previously-established booth and SLAM
     into it.

     The doctor harshly tosses Eric onto the dining table. He
     looks at Jeff and Finn.

                          DOCTOR
               Alright, what are ya havin'?

     Jeff looks at the doctor seriously.

                          JEFF
               I need a souffle, and I need a
               souffle, now! And do BE QUIET about
               it!

     The doctor nods, turns to Finn.

                          FINN
               I'll have two number nines, a
               number nine large, a number six
               with extra dip, a number seven, two
               number forty-fives, one with
               cheese, and a large soda.

     The doctor nods along with all of this.

                          FINN (CONT’D)
               Oh, and the TV is broken.

     He gestures towards the TV.

     The doctor beckons a nurse over. The male nurse is in PURPLE
     scrubs, and has a large beard.

                          PURPLE
               I heard there were equipment
               problems. I'm here to serve you.

     Eric COUGHS and a spurt of blood comes out of his mouth.

                          PURPLE (CONT’D)
               Time enough!

     Purple reaches onto Eric's bloody mouth and starts pulling
     out tools. First he pulls out a syringe. Then a screwdriver.
     A golf club. A baseball bat. Finally, a sledgehammer.

                          PURPLE (CONT’D)
               Well then, let's get started!

     He takes his bloody pile of tools over to the TV and gets to
     work.

                          DOCTOR
                    (to Purple)
               Would you please BE QUIET! I'm
               trying to serve these boys!

     Purple bangs louder. The doctor gets more upset.

                          DOCTOR (CONT’D)
               I said BE, QUIET!

     Louder and louder banging. The doctor looks like he's about
     to bust an artery in anger.

     The lights FLICKER as LIGHTNING CRACKS across the sky
     outside.

     As this happens, Eric jolts upright on the table.

                          ERIC
               Aw geez, I don't feel so good.

     He begins to struggle with something. As if he's fighting
     back vomit.

                          PURPLE
               Eureka!

     Holding the sledgehammer, he winds up and takes a full-force
     swing at the TV.

     SMASH! He makes contact and the glass SHATTERS, revealing a
     perfectly good TV screen where the broken TV should be.

     Eric starts vomiting up marshmallows. Just hundreds of them.
     All sizes. Big ones, small ones. You name it. They're fuckin'
     goin' all over, just WOW so many MALLOWS.

     On the TV:

     A red silhouette and a blue silhouette waggle their dicks
     around, and a distorted and muffled vocal harmony plays.

                          PURPLE (CONT’D)
               All for you, and you for all.

     BANG! The front door to the restaurant opens up, and a
     silver-skinned man in a silver jumpsuit enters. This is 14.
     He is holding a souffle in one hand.

     The TV shuts off. Eric falls limp on the table.

     14 walks over towards the table.

                          14
               I have seen all possible futures.

     This statement is met with silence.

                          14 (CONT’D)
               I have been sent to this timeline
               to ensure the best possible future.

     Nobody reacts.

     14 pulls Eric off of the table, and slings him over his
     shoulder. 14 sets the souffle on the table in his place.

                          14 (CONT’D)
               Goodbye forever.

     14 leaves the restaurant, with Eric in tow.

     The doctor and nurses all start shaking each others' hands
     and congratulating them all on their success.

     They continue to do this as they bring the stretcher with
     them back out the double doors from whence they came.

     Jeff and Finn lift up two forks each.

                          JEFF & FINN
                    (in sync)
               Time enough for food.

     They dig in.
