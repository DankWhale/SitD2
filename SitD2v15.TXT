               FADE IN: 

               EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

               A perfectly baked souffle sits on a semi-cleared trail on 
               the forest floor among leaf litter and twigs.  A shoe steps 
               right on it, keeps moving.  The shoe is worn by JEFF, hairy 
               man with green glasses.  Alongside him walk FINN, hairy fat 
               man, and ERIC, little twink.  They carry blunt instruments 
               like baseball bats, golf clubs, and sledgehammers.

                                     FINN
                         Looks like you got a little souffle 
                         on ya.

               Jeff speaks slow and stilted, the word-making gears almost 
               audibly turning.

                                     JEFF
                         Souffle Enya.

               Eric whines.

                                     ERIC
                         If I said that you guys would be 
                         like "fuck you, Uwe!"

               Finn and Jeff share a look of disgust.

                                     JEFF
                         Eric, would you BE QUIET?!  And learn 
                         your own goddamn name.

                                     FINN
                         Yeah seriously, stop trying to make 
                         "Uwe" happen.

               They come near an old wooden fort, crushed beneath a fallen 
               tree, stop walking.

               There's a gaping hole in the top of the fort, but it otherwise 
               retained its fort shape.

                                     FINN
                         Damn it...we're too late.

                                     JEFF
                         I thought we'd have time enough, 
                         but...alas.

                                     FINN
                         Well, maybe the guy's still in there.

               Jeff scoffs.

                                     JEFF
                         Yeah, he's gonna pop his head out of 
                         that sad roof hole any second now.

                                     FINN
                         Or like a periscope peeps outta there.

               Eric gets giddy like a little boy.

                                     ERIC
                         Like Das Boot or like U-five-seven-
                         one!?

               They glare at Eric.  Radio silence.

                                     ERIC
                         ...Ahem.

                Jeff shrugs to Finn.

                                     JEFF
                         Welp, guess our quest continues.  We 
                         ain't stopping 'til we find the guy.

               Eric laughs.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh god.

               Finn is not amused. 

                                     FINN
                         Shut up, Eric.  We're finding the 
                         guy.  You wanna fuckin' lead the 
                         way?

               Finn gestures his hand toward the direction they were headed 
               before.

               Eric chuckles.

               Jeff sighs, face-palms, resumes walking.

                                     JEFF
                         This is fucking ridiculous, we're 
                         wasting time.

               The others join him walking.

                                     JEFF
                         Figures the fort would be the thing 
                         a tree lands on.  Surprised the 
                         souffle was still intact.  Something 
                         coulda easily torn that thing to 
                         shreds out here.

               Erin grins like an idiot.

                                     ERIC
                         That reminds me of, uh, "Will It 
                         Blend?"  A-heh-heh.

                Jeff loses his cool.

                                     JEFF
                         Oh would you BE QUIET?!

               A cauldron of bats flies past them at about head level.  
               They duck just in time to evade them, tighten grips on their 
               blunt objects.

               They all look anxious...until Eric cracks a smile, holds a 
               baseball bat up.

                                     ERIC
                         Some BAT ass action!

               Jeff and Finn look like they could murder him.

               Eric grins on.

                                     ERIC
                         A bat's a-where it's at!

               Finn looks at Jeff, deflated.

                                     FINN
                         Why did we have to bring HIM?

                                     JEFF
                         He's the right one for the job, just 
                         trust me.

               They start to resume their walk, but there's another fallen 
               tree in the way of the beaten path.  They halt before it.

                                     ERIC
                         Do we have an ax?

                                     JEFF
                         We don't need a fucking ax.  We go 
                         around it and back onto the beaten 
                         path.  Fuck's sake...

               They walk to the left of the fallen tree.

               Their way is soon crowded with brush and thickets.  They 
               shove small trunks and branches out of their way to pass 
               through.

                                     ERIC
                         You ever like play, uhhhh, like, 
                         sword-fighting with things like trees, 
                         and...stuff?

                                     FINN
                         You ever play uhhh, shut the fuck up 
                         Eric?

               Eric chuckles. 

               Jeff looks around, slows his pace.

                                     JEFF
                         Wait a minute...

                                     FINN
                         What?

                                     JEFF
                         Weren't we...we turned back right 
                         after the tree, but I haven't seen 
                         the path again.

                                     FINN
                         Oh wait, yeah, no.  It should've 
                         been here.  I guess it just ended.

                                     JEFF
                         So we...just keep going the direction 
                         the path should've gone to?

                                     FINN
                         I mean, I guess we just go until we 
                         see the clearing.

               They shrug it off and continue on.

               EXT. THE WOODS - LATER

               A shoe steps on a patch of forest floor, keeps moving.  The 
               shoe was Finn's.  The three still walk on through a pathless 
               forest.

                                     FINN
                         So we're definitely lost, right?

                                     JEFF
                         Well, in horror movie fashion I feel 
                         like we've walked past the same exact 
                         landmarks repeatedly, but we haven't 
                         changed direction once.  So the next 
                         scene is probably us all dying.

                                     ERIC
                         Aaaaaand...action!

               Finn droops his head, rubs his eyes.

                                     FINN
                         For the longest time we didn't have 
                         to hear him fucking say anything.  
                         At least we had that going for us.

               Eric sings (poorly):

                                     ERIC
                         Whoooooa-ohhhhh...for the longest 
                         time.

               Jeff grips a baseball bat like iron, steels his eyes at Eric.

                                     JEFF
                         One of us at least I can see dying.

               Eric pantomimes hitting himself in the head with one of his 
               bats, acts out a terrible cartoony response to the feigned 
               bludgeoning.

                                     ERIC
                         Bwoooooa-waaaaa!

               He smiles at the others like he did something entertaining.

               Jeff closes his eyes, mouths expletives, looks at Finn.

                                     JEFF
                         I mean we have to just keep moving, 
                         right?  How much choice do we have?  
                         Let's bounce.

                                     ERIC
                         Biggety bounce...

               The others act like they didn't hear him, resume the journey 
               looking frustrated.

                                     FINN
                         At least we're well-armed in the 
                         event that we do need to kill out 
                         here.

               Eric hold up his bat proudly.

                                     ERIC
                         I've got the li'l slugger!

               Jeff sighs.

                                     JEFF
                         Okay.  Eric.  Take this.

               Jeff hands Eric a small, crappy video camera.

               Eric examines it like it's alien technology.

                                     JEFF
                         Just point that ahead of you, hit 
                         the red button, and document the 
                         path we're taking, because right now 
                         I simply can't believe we're really 
                         going in circles.  We can review the 
                         footage later and see if it proves 
                         we're really total idiots.  Or they'll 
                         find it once we're dead and it makes 
                         a good horror movie.

               Eric fumbles with the camera, manages to point it forward 
               and hit the red button.  He seems pleased.

               Jeff and Finn look troubled as they trek. 

                                     ERIC
                         How about we just put night shot on 
                         from here on out, for some reason.

               Eric flicks a switch on the camera. 

               They ignore him completely, just proceed to walk.

                                     ERIC
                         ...Super night shot.

                                     JEFF
                         Super...shot in the...face.

                                     FINN
                         Super...shooter...shoopy, soupy...

                                     ERIC
                         Shooby dot bot doo-wop?

               Jeff shakes his head soberly.

                                     JEFF
                         I don't know if I can deal with this 
                         for much longer.

                                     FINN
                         Which part?

                                     JEFF
                         All the parts.  At first it was just 
                         Eric, which, don't get me wrong, 
                         this would be much better if we were 
                         here without him...

               Eric sings (obnoxiously):

                                     ERIC
                         Out there without me.

                                     JEFF
                         ...but this endless fucking repeating 
                         forest is really getting to me.

                                     FINN
                         How 'bout, just, let's have a seat.

               Finn find some logs beside them suitable for sitting.  He 
               pops a squat followed by Jeff.

               Eric sits down adjacent, sighs like he hasn't rested in days.

               Finn and Jeff gaze into nothingness, dead sober expressions.

               Eric discovers the camera viewfinder, peaks into it.

                                     ERIC
                         Ope, night shot doesn't work in the 
                         day.  Funny.

               Jeff grumbles.

                                     JEFF
                         So turn it off.

               Eric turns the camera every which way, inspects, flicks a 
               switch, then another.

                                     JEFF
                         You flicked it OFF, right?  You 
                         flicked a thing, and then another 
                         thing.

               Eric looks sheepish, turns the camera again...flicks a switch.

                                     JEFF
                         Is it fucking on or off now?! 

               Eric is contrite. 

                                     ERIC
                         Sorry, sorry, I was doing it again!

               Jeff gets up, snatches the camera.

                                     ERIC
                         What are you doing? 

               Jeff peers into the viewfinder, hands the camera back to 
               Eric.

                                     JEFF
                         Okay, just say it's off next time 
                         it's off.  I don't know what the 
                         hell you're doing with that thing.

               Jeff slumps beside Finn, who looks at Jeff deadpan.

                                     FINN
                         So we could watch Eric's shitty night 
                         vision footage, and see if it sheds 
                         any light on anything.

                                     JEFF
                         Ha! ...Light.  Yeah, let's, sure.

               EXT. THE WOODS - LATER

               The three sit beside each other on a log all looking at the 
               same thing, their blunt objects propped against the log.  
               Sounds of their earlier conversations are heard.

               The camera is in Jeff's hands, a viewing panel on the side 
               of the camera opened so they can watch via a screen.

                                     ERIC
                         I'm confused as to the dialogue, 
                         'cause...

               Finn and Jeff look dumfounded.  Finn interrupts him.

                                     FINN
                         Eric, this isn't a goddamn scripted 
                         scene we did.  It's random bullshit 
                         we happened to be saying.

               Eric is all flustered. 

                                     ERIC
                         No, I'm confused to when- ...how am 
                         I gonna pa-  ...when am I gonna, 
                         when am I gonna have to time to pa-

               Jeff interrupts this time.

                                     JEFF
                         Eric.  The task was to point the 
                         camera forward to track where we 
                         walked.  Anything else happening is 
                         totally irrelevant.

                                     FINN
                         I mean it's all in goddamn night 
                         vision, but the frame at least mostly 
                         captured  the path, like just around 
                         where we walked.

               Eric breaks into song again.

                                     ERIC
                         Just around the bay...

               They study the camera screen.  Finn points at it.

                                     FINN
                         Okay, see that weird tree there?  
                         I've specifically been trying to see 
                         if that comes up multiple times, 
                         and, like, it fucking does.

               Finn takes out his cell phone.

               His phone's camera app is open, shows the weird tree on the 
               video camera screen in frame.  He snaps a photo.

               Finn hits buttons on the video camera.

                                     FINN
                         Just gonna rewind a bit, and then 
                         we'll see the exact same weird tree 
                         again, and...

               Finn hits a camera button, points at the screen.

                                     FINN
                         There.

               On the screen, the same exact weird tree Finn took a picture 
               of.  Also in frame are Jeff's legs, the one he stepped into 
               souffle with being weirdly covered in souffle mess that was 
               not there before.

               Jeff studies the screen, perturbed.

                                     JEFF
                         Hold up.

               He points at the screen.

               They have a closer look at the souffle leg on the screen.

               Jeff looks down at his own leg, yelps.  It's got souffle 
               caked all over the lower part.

               Finn checks it out, puzzled.

                                     JEFF
                         Only my shoe got it, and that was 
                         like, what, hours ago?  Time enough.

                                     FINN
                         Yeah, that was not all filthy and 
                         dirty with souffle like that.

               Eric doesn't share their concern.

                                     ERIC
                         It's an EXTRA dirty boy!

                                     JEFF
                         Shut the fuck up, Eric.

               Jeff sighs, brushes as much souffle off his leg as he can.

                                     ERIC
                         Got your dirt...?  Dirty boy?

               Jeff is exasperated. 

                                     JEFF
                         Shut up!

               They sit a moment not really doing anything.

                                     ERIC
                         What's next?

               A lone bat swoops down on Eric, hovers about his head.  He 
               freaks out, swats impotently at it.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh god!  NO!

               Jeff picks up a baseball bat, swings at the bat, makes 
               contact.  The bat squeals and flies off.

               Jeff brings the end of the bat toward his face, inspects, 
               grimaces.

               The end of the bat has souffle mess all over it.

               There's some souffle mess that splattered onto Eric's head.  
               He wipes some off his brow.

                                     ERIC
                         I'm not very good at brow-wiping, 
                         but...

               His face still looks a sloppy mess.

               Finn and Jeff give Eric sour looks.

                                     ERIC
                         Reacting to faces...

               Jeff smacks the back of Eric's head, causing some souffle 
               bits to drop.

                                     ERIC
                         Ow, that hurt me.

               Finn smacks Eric on the side of his head.  More souffle falls.

               Eric's eyes roll back for a second.

                                     ERIC
                         Whooooa, gettin' dizzy.

               Jeff stands from the log, takes a bat.

                                     JEFF
                         Alright.  We confirmed we walked in 
                         a loop.  And souffle has gotten into 
                         every damn thing.  So I don't know 
                         what's next.  We'll take a quick, 
                         uh, pan around this area to like see 
                         if anything looks like a path to 
                         somewhere better.

               Eric sounds annoyed.

                                     ERIC
                         What's quick pan?!

               Finn also stands, grabs a club.

                                     FINN
                         Shut up, Eric.  Just sit there and 
                         watch a couple pros.

               Finn and Jeff start to leave him.

                                     JEFF
                         It'll be funny if the bat comes back 
                         for him.

                                     ERIC
                         So wait, it's funny to have an 
                         audience that's not enjoying 
                         themselves?

               Finn and Jeff both laugh.

               The two of them smack brush around with bat and club, examine 
               the surroundings.

               Finn kneels down, gazes at something on the ground.

               A marshmallow sits on the forest floor.  Finn's hand lowers 
               to pick it up.

               Finn stands back up.

                                     FINN
                         Jeff.  Take a sweet look.

               Jeff turns, heads over, raises his glasses out of his eye 
               line to check it out.

                                     JEFF
                         Sweet Jesus.

               Eric dicks around on his phone back at the log.

               His phone is frozen on a blank browser window.  He pokes at 
               the screen but nothing happens.

                                     ERIC
                         Open your window.  For the love of 
                         god!

               The others stride back to him.

                                     FINN
                         Alright Eric, get up.

                                     JEFF
                         We're gonna need a certain someone 
                         to pop up in that tree with the 
                         camera.  See if we can get a three 
                         hundred sixty degree pan shot of the 
                         area outside of these thickets.

               Eric sounds irritated.

                                     ERIC
                         We can get it from inside, why the 
                         hell not?

               The others are now pissed.

                                     JEFF
                         Eric, fuck you.  Before you were 
                         just being a dipshit, now suddenly 
                         you're coppin' this pissy attitude?

                                     FINN
                         We found a mallow trail but it leads 
                         into thickets we can't see past.  
                         Get in the goddamn tree.

               EXT. THE WOODS - LATER

               Eric is climbing a tree branch, frightened, hesitant.  He 
               shakily pushes his legs up higher, peers over a branch.

               There's a clearing past a thicket, with a little trail of 
               marshmallows going into it.

               Eric slowly crouches down, lowers a leg.

               Finn and Jeff chat to one another below the tree, bats resting 
               above their shoulders.

                                     FINN
                         Was thinking about putting a sound 
                         system in my garage.  Crank some 
                         dirty jams while I'm working on the 
                         car, y'know?

                                     JEFF
                         That's what's up.  Nice and loud so 
                         the neighbors can enjoy, y'know what 
                         I'm sayin'?

               Eric makes his way back down to earth, dusts himself off. 

                                     ERIC
                         Don't scare neighbors, I hate it 
                         when people do that.

               The other two scoff at the boy.

                                     JEFF
                         So what's the word?  The mallows 
                         going to the promised land or what?

               Eric struggles for an explanation.

                                     ERIC
                         Uhhhhh...

                                     FINN
                         ...Yes?  No?

                                     ERIC
                         Nnnnooo...

                                     JEFF
                         Do we need to shove you back up that 
                         tree?

                                     ERIC
                         Aughhh...

               Finn approaches Eric.

                                     FINN
                         Alright, get him back up.

               They get behind Eric, prod him along toward the tree.  Eric 
               trips forward, flat on his face.

               Eric's shoes are tied together.

               Finn and Jeff notice this fact.  They're nonplussed.

                                     JEFF
                         Did you tie your own shoelaces 
                         together while you were up in a damn 
                         tree?  While you were supposed to be 
                         scouting?

                                     FINN
                         I'd be more angry if I wasn't so 
                         confused how you even did that, from 
                         a shoe tier point of view.

                                     ERIC
                         What kinda tier's made outta shoes?

               Jeff smacks his own face in disgust, wrenches the laces apart, 
               lifts Eric up to shove him back at the tree.

                                     ERIC
                         You drive so harshly, Jeff.

               Eric is at the tree, hands on it, with Jeff at his heels 
               forcing him upward.

               Eric, again apprehensive, climbs some.

               He stops at the same point as before, points in the direction 
               of the clearing, looks back to make sure the others see him.

               Jeff and Finn nod soberly at each other below.

               Eric begins his climb down.

               Jeff and Finn whisper to each other, chuckle, move toward 
               the tree.

               They start to vigorously shake the tree trunk.

               Eric hugs the trunk for dear life.

               The fellas keep shaking, taunt him.

                                     FINN
                         Eric, what are you doing?  Get out 
                         of the tree.

               Eric doesn't seem to perceive the humor.

                                     ERIC
                         You gotta STOP to get me out.

               They stop, sigh.

                                     JEFF
                         Damn it, Eric.  You even take the 
                         fun out of us making fun of you.

               Eric sits on a branch, pushes himself off.

               He tumbles to the ground, a fall much higher than it should 
               have been.

               He smacks the ground, unconscious.

               INT. SHODDY VAN - DAY

               Eric lies prostrate in the back of an old van filled with 
               random trash, and the gang's blunt objects.  The double doors 
               in the rear are open.  Eric stirs, lifts his face.

               Finn and Jeff walk up to the open van.

                                     JEFF
                         Ah, he's awake.

                                     FINN
                         You had a bit of a tumble, fella.  
                         It's fine, we dragged you around the 
                         thicket and made it to the mallow 
                         clearing.  There was a van here. 

               Eric turns over, sits up, rubs his head.

               EXT. THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

               Eric slips out of the van, peers around.

               There are multiple other vans around, all in a circle 
               formation. 

               Eric whines.

                                     ERIC
                         Ohhhh, there are even MORE cars HERE!

               Jeff and Finn pick up bats.

                                     FINN
                         Yeah, we're gonna get out there and 
                         inspect.  This seems like a place 
                         the guy might hang around in.

                                     JEFF
                         Yep.  Be ready when we're back.

               They head out between two vans. 

                                     ERIC
                         Which, which way are you guys gonna 
                         come from?

               They ignore him, keep on trucking away.

                                     ERIC
                         Which way are you coming from?

               They're gone.

               INT. SHODDY VAN - LATER

               Eric sits in the back of the van, in a real uncomfortable 
               looking position.

                                     ERIC
                         Wouldn't it be easier for me to be 
                         in the front?

               The front of the van has two empty seats.

               He tries to move up there, finds it too awkward to squeeze 
               between the seats, slumps back down into the van bed.

                                     ERIC
                         Ahh, damn it all.

               He lies his back right on a jagged, hard object.

                                     ERIC
                         Ahh, god.

               The back van doors are partially open.

               Eric sits in silence...then a distant sound of a blunt object 
               smashing some kind of metal object.

               Eric sits up at attention, looks toward the front of the van 
               out the windshield.

                                     ERIC
                         Wait, whoa-whoa-whoa.

               The sound recurs, is joined by a second sound of blunt 
               smashing.  Eric struggles to view out the windshield.

                                     ERIC
                         This would be SO much easier if I 
                         was in the front!

               The noises are replaced by gross goopy splattering noises. 

                                     ERIC
                         I thought-

               He interrupts himself with a chuckle.

               Those noises stop.  Suddenly, a falsetto harmony instead.  
               Eric is extra confused.

                                     ERIC
                         What are you DOING?

               The noise becomes a loud electric tool slicing through 
               something.

                                     ERIC
                         The fuck is goin' on?

               EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

               Finn and Jeff pant beside each other, blunt objects in tow.  
               Finn puts a hand on Jeff's shoulder.

                                     FINN
                         Let's go back.

               Jeff shrugs. 

                                     JEFF
                         Alright.

               They're back at the van circle, swing open van doors to reveal 
               Eric.

                                     JEFF
                         Alright, we figured it out.  Grab 
                         the bats and we're off.

               Eric seems reluctant, but grabs the remaining bats out of 
               the van, hops out.

               Jeff and Finn lead him past a van.  They hang a sharp left 
               after this.

               Eric peers back at the van circle they left behind. 

                                     ERIC
                         Why'd you keep GOING?

               They sigh to each other.

                                     ERIC
                         Why'd you turn around HERE?

                                     JEFF
                         We found out where to go.  There's 
                         nothing for us back at the vans.  
                         Just shut up and follow along.

               By their feet as they walk, more mallows mark the way forward.  
               They're shaped like cubes.

                                     ERIC
                         Guess they like cubes.

               They try not to even react to that.

                                     JEFF
                         Eric, got an idea for you.  Occupy 
                         yourself by counting the numbers of 
                         mallows I've passed so far.

                         We're all passing the same number of 
                         mallows, it doesn't fucking matter.

                         Oh...okay.

               A lone bat flies up to them from the front, lands right on 
               the mallow trail, falls through a sheet of leaves that covered 
               a gaping pit.  It flies out from the pit, skedaddles.

               They halt, stare at the pit, at each other, stunned.  Finn 
               and Eric are slightly closer to the pit than Jeff. 

                                     ERIC
                         We woulda died first, Finn.

               Jeff clears his throat.

                         I'm beginning to doubt the 
                         trustworthiness of the mallows.

                         I agree.  And also I agree about the 
                         staying on the path.  I guess.

               EXT. THE WOODS - LATER

               Daylight is visibly fading.  They walk in the direction of, 
               but off to the side of, the beaten mallow path, come to the 
               end of a wooded area, a filthy marsh now before them.

                                     ERIC

                         A whole newww worrrld!

               Finn stiffs Eric with a bat to the chest. 

               Jeff lifts his glasses out of his eyeline, squints beyond 
               the marsh.

               On the forest floor, the mallow trail leads straight into 
               the marsh.  One mallow is halfway in it.

               Jeff motions at this mallow.

                                     JEFF
                         Eric, pick up that mallow. 

                                     ERIC
                         Why don't we just pick it up from 
                         somewhere else?

               Jeff stiffs him the chest with a club.

                                     JEFF
                         You numbskull, don't you get it?  
                         It's a MARSH mallow.

               Eric doesn't appear to get it, but nonetheless leans down to 
               scoop it out.

               The part of the mallow that was in the marsh is flaked with 
               bits of souffle.

               Jeff nods at the mallow.

                                     JEFF
                         Just as I thought.  Do we still have 
                         that camera?

               Finn feels around at his back pockets, pulls out the camera, 
               which would not fit into a back pocket.

                                     FINN
                         I hear ya.

               Finn puts the camera viewfinder to his eye, points at the 
               marsh, hits record.

               In the camera viewfinder: The whole marsh looks like a massive 
               souffle pool.  A click sound.  Suddenly the image turns to 
               night vision.

               Finn lowers the camera, glares at Eric.

                         W'okay!

               Finn brings the camera over to Jeff.

                         Better take a look.

               Jeff peers into the viewfinder, nods.

                                     JEFF
                         It's all making sense now.

               Through the viewfinder: at the other end of the souffle marsh, 
               50 to 100 feet away, the trail of mallows continues. 

               He lowers the camera, hands it back to Finn.

                                     JEFF
                         We'll have to cross.  The only 
                         question is...how?

               Jeff scans the area, spots an errant trash can lid.

                                     JEFF
                         Bingo.

               Jeff moseys to the lid, grabs it, places it atop the marsh.

                                     JEFF
                         This little boat here is ours for 
                         the boating.  Eric, get on first. 

                                     ERIC
                         Does it belong to us?

               Deadpan stares from Jeff and Finn. 

                                     ERIC
                         ...Yeah then it's ours.

               He chuckles.

               The others guide him toward the "boat".

                                     FINN
                         Easy now, onto the boat.

               Eric acquiesces reluctantly, takes a step onto the lid, then 
               another.  He sinks into marsh filth along with the lid.

               The other two shake their heads with all of their disgust.

               Eric crawls his way back onto dry land, covered in souffle.

               Jeff puts his hands on his hips reproachfully.

                                     JEFF
                         Well Eric, can you guess how we feel 
                         about your efforts?

               Eric does a poor impression of the others' reproaches: 

                                     ERIC
                         God damn it...Eric, fuck!  Fuck you!  
                         Eric, gah!

               Finn shrugs.

                                     FINN
                         That's pretty much what we say.

                                     JEFF
                         We'll have another dialogue about 
                         your shortcomings later on Eric, but 
                         for the time being, we gotta come up 
                         with another plan.

               Eric bitches: 

                                     ERIC
                         The dialogue was fi-iiiine!

                                     JEFF
                         Shut up, Eric!

               Jeff and Finn scramble for other useful materials nearby.  
               Something catches Finn's attention.

                                     FINN
                         Oh, hey.

               There's an actual boat, a dirty old cheap canoe, not even 
               far from them.

                                     JEFF
                         Oh.

               Finn and Jeff shove the boat out from some brush toward the 
               marsh, slide it halfway into the water.

                                     JEFF
                         Alright, Eric, get in. 

                                     ERIC
                         Uhhh...no.

                                     JEFF
                         Eric, god damn it.  It's an actual 
                         boat this time, it's fine.

               Eric almost steps inside, peeks in the boat. 
               

               There's a little spider web in the corner inside it.

               Eric sounds like a frightened little girl.

                                     ERIC
                         There's spiders...

                                     FINN
                         There's no spiders, it's fine.

               Finn gives Eric a nudge into the boat.  Eric makes a feeble, 
               defeated sort of noise, sits down in it.

               The others get in next.  The boat tips a bit, but stays 
               afloat.  Jeff and Finn use bats to push the boat off from 
               shore.

               They use bats to paddle across the marsh, pass random objects 
               floating in the filth.

               They close in on the shore.  The boat hits land.  They step 
               out of it, back onto earth.

               The mallow trail shows the way back into woods, albeit into 
               dense thickets.

               The trio tries to follow the path of mallows but it proves 
               difficult with all the growth in the way.

               Eric gets into a fit over it. 

                                     ERIC
                         Fuck...fucking growing!  AHHH! 

               Finn swings at brush with two bats at once, sort of clears 
               some of it, plows past.

               Jeff tries to kick a small tree out of his way but it bounces 
               back.

                                     JEFF
                         Alright, this isn't going the best.  
                         Does anyone even see the mallows 
                         anymore?

               The ground is so thick with plants that no mallows can be 
               seen.

               Jeff strokes his chin, pulls a bunch of chin skin downward.

                                     JEFF
                         I've just birthed an idea.  Finn, 
                         you still got the camera? 

                                     ERIC
                         I got the camera.

               Eric takes the camera out of a back pocket it wouldn't fit 
               in.

                                     JEFF
                         Okay, whatever.  Just turn it on and 
                         record the surroundings.  Do a three 
                         sixty.

               Eric clumsily points the camera around, his hands trembling.

                                     ERIC
                         My hand's really shaky 'cause I'm 
                         hungry.

                                     JEFF
                         Just do a circle.  It's not that 
                         hard.

               Eric, camera shaking all over the place, starts to giggle.

                                     ERIC
                         I kinda fucked that up.

               Jeff loses patience with him yet again.

                                     JEFF
                         How?! 

                                     ERIC
                         I was laughing, and then I- okay...

               Jeff throws his hands up.

                                     JEFF
                         Well- fucking, do it again.

               Eric does another spin with the camera, more competent this 
               time.

               Jeff and Finn approach Eric on each side.  Eric flips the 
               camera screen panel out.

               On the camera screen, in place of three large trees around 
               them off-camera, are a RED man, a BLUE man, and a bearded 
               PURPLE man, almost color swaps of the same man, equidistant 
               from each other in a circle around the camera, each doing a 
               falsetto harmony part, nodding at the camera, waggling their 
               exposed dicks around.

               Jeff and Finn nod soberly at the screen.  Eric raises a brow 
               at those two.

                                     FINN
                         Any of those three guys the guy? 

                                     ERIC
                         Are they three separate- Are they 
                         three separate-?

               Jeff slaps Eric upside the head.

                                     JEFF
                         I don't think so, but I find it 
                         curious that we weren't in frame 
                         somehow in this.

               Eric is super flustered and whiny. 

                                     ERIC
                         You are not the focus at all, you 
                         guys- Oh my god...

                                     FINN
                         We were IN the radius that should've 
                         been in frame as you circled, so 
                         what exactly WERE you focusing on?

               The purple man walks up behind Finn, in real life, pops a 
               hand onto Finn's shoulder.  Finn's head whips back to him.  
               Purple speaks with a slow, unsettling tone.

                                     PURPLE
                         Yes.  What WERE you focusing on?

               Eric is more flustered now, barely can make a sentence:  

                                     ERIC
                         I was focusing on like what you three 
                         guys were standing next to each other 
                         for the nodding soberly, I- Okay...

               Jeff narrows his eyes, glances between everyone.

                                     JEFF
                         Okay...Hold on.  THREE guys.  So you 
                         saw US in the viewfinder, or you saw 
                         colored men through it?

               The other three look taken aback at what Jeff said.

               Jeff realizes what he said, rushes to clarify. 

                                     JEFF
                         No, no no!  Colored like...

               Jeff points to purple man.

                                     JEFF
                         He's purple.  Like he's, not a natural 
                         color.

                                     PURPLE
                         Why don't we try it again?  Get us 
                         all in frame, Eric.

               Purple stretches his arms out at his sides.

               Eric readies the camera at them.

               Jeff is a bit further from the other two, purple's arm on 
               Finn again. 

               Eric sounds desperate, then gives up: 

                                     ERIC
                         Jeff, you gotta get close enough 
                         man, you got- Eh...

               Jeff scoffs, disgusted, moves closer to Finn.

                                     JEFF
                         Or you just fucking move back, or 
                         zoom out.  Jesus.

               Eric raises the camera viewfinder back to his eyeline.

               Through the camera: Finn is now the red man, and Jeff the 
               blue man.  Purple is some entirely different man, with silver 
               skin and a silver jumpsuit, to be revealed as FOURTEEN.

               Eric behaves a scared child. 

                                     ERIC
                         I gotta go!  I gotta go, I-!

               Eric slowly retreats but still looks into the camera and 
               points at the others.

               Through the camera, the others walk forward with each step 
               back that Eric takes. 

               Eric makes a series of terrible whining noises.  He rips the 
               camera from his eyeline, shuts his eyes, shields his face 
               with an arm.  A silver hand touches Eric on the head.  Eric 
               opens an eye to view the stranger.

               Fourteen, in the non-camera realm, removes his hand from 
               Eric's head.  He speaks to Eric in a monotone, stilted way.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Greetings.  I was sent from the 
                         future.  I have seen all possible 
                         futures, and have come to make sure 
                         the best possible future occurs.  I 
                         am fourteen.  Not thirteen.  Not 
                         fifteen.  Not sixteen, like your 
                         cheap camera's bits of audio.  
                         Seventeen, never.

                                     ERIC
                         What does sixteen bit audio mean?

               Finn smacks Eric upside the head. 

               Eric giggles.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Come.  We must go, to the rendezvous 
                         point.

               Fourteen grabs a nearby bat, club, and the sledgehammer.  
               The sledge quickly tumbles out of his arm, smacks the ground.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         That was supposed to happen.

               Fourteen picks it back up awkwardly. 

               Eric reproaches the silver stranger. 

                                     ERIC
                         Careful with the sledge.  Careful 
                         with the druuuudge!

               Finn and Jeff look at each other, arms held up in bafflement.  
               They pick up more bats and clubs, follow Fourteen away.

               There are no bats or clubs left for Eric, so he maintains 
               charge of the camera, scurries after them. 

                                     ERIC
                         Wha- what if I turned on night shot, 
                         think that'd be cooool?

               There's indistinct chatter ahead between Finn, Jeff, and 
               Fourteen, no reactions to Eric. 

                                     ERIC
                         Aw, okay I'll keep it off.

               Eric brings the camera back to his eye, flicks a certain 
               switch.

                                     ERIC
                         ...Ultra night shot. 

               EXT. THE WOODS, CAMPFIRE - EVENING

               There's a blazing campfire built in the woods. 

               There are four large rocks surrounding the campfire in a 
               cleared area of forest, the rocks seating Fourteen, across 
               from Eric, and Jeff and Finn across from each other.

               Fourteen sits stiffly with his hands on his knees, address 
               the rest.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Okay.  What are we doin'?

               Jeff looks uncomfortable.

                                     JEFF
                         I...thought you were gonna tell US 
                         that.  It took us like all day to 
                         find you.  I thought the whole point 
                         was to find you, and you tell us 
                         what's up.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         I know.  I had to ask you so that 
                         you would say that.  Now I can tell 
                         you.

               Finn and Jeff share an uneasy glance to each other.  Eric 
               just sits with his mouth open.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         So anyway.  Eric, do you understand 
                         who I am?

               Eric responds like some goofy doofus. 

                                     ERIC
                         Mm-hmmm.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Then you must understand that we 
                         must do all that is necessary to 
                         save the future?

               Eric responds in an ever dopier way, half-chuckling. 

                                     ERIC
                         Hmmmm-hm-hm.

               Fourteen looks awkwardly at Jeff and Finn, back to Eric.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         So then, you know what role you must 
                         play in this, right? 

               He breaks into song...again:

                                     ERIC
                         Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

               Fourteen rises, hands clasped, strolls around the fire to 
               Eric.

               Eric watches Fourteen's route until he go goes behind Eric.  
               Fourteen stops.  Then he stabs Eric through the shoulder 
               with a syringe.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Nighty night.

               Eric barely reacts, points to the syringe tip over his 
               shoulder.

                                     ERIC
                         It's off the shot.

               The tip went out through the other end of his skin, purple 
               fluid oozing out of the syringe.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Of course it is.  That had to happen 
                         so that the best future can happen.

               Fourteen stabs Eric with another syringe in that shoulder.

               Eric's eyes glaze over, a sedate smile on his lips. 

                                     ERIC
                         There you go, that's a good one.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Excellent.  Now we-

               Eric interrupts him, taps his other shoulder. 

                                     ERIC
                         M'kay, this side.

               Fourteen looks like he didn't predict this, rummages in his 
               jumpsuit a bit, pulls out a third syringe, stabs his other 
               shoulder. 

                                     ERIC
                         No, it keeps bouncing off the shot.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         What does that even mean?  It's not.  
                         It's totally in there. 

               Eric sniggers, sways in his chair, clearly intoxicated from 
               the purple fluid.

               Fourteen turns to the other two.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         He should be unconscious by now.  
                         What is this?

               They don't have an answer.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         I mean, I know what it is.  I've 
                         seen all of this from the futures.  
                         Uh.  Gimme a second.

               Fourteen walks away from the campfire, fades into the darkness 
               of the woods.

               Finn and Jeff have nothing to say but seem anxious.

               Eric can barely sit up straight, looks happy.

                                     FINN
                         He's...coming back, right?

                                     JEFF
                         I...

               Fourteen comes back carrying an unzipped sleeping bag.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Okay, help me out here.

               Finn and Jeff stand, follow Fourteen over to Eric.

               Fourteen hands Finn the sleeping bag, grabs Eric's legs.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Alright, let's get him in.

               Eric doesn't resist.  Finn brings the sleeping bag under 
               Eric's legs.  Fourteen lifts Eric's torso, dumps his body 
               further into the bag.  Jeff grabs the top of the sleeping 
               bag, pulls up until Eric is quite inside.

               Fourteen zips the zipper up near Eric's face.  Eric seems 
               out of it, gawks at the zipper. 

                                     ERIC
                         What's YKK?

               Fourteen starts to drag the Eric bag away from the fire.  
               Finn and Jeff follow the leader.

                                     FINN
                         It's uhhhh where they put on white 
                         costumes and uh, smash up crosses, 
                         and colored men.

               Eric is delirious. 

                                     ERIC
                         Hulk smash...in costume.

                                     FINN
                         That's right, Eric.

               EXT. THE WOODS - NIGHT

               It has gotten rather dark.  They keep dragging the Eric bag, 
               too far from the fire or other light to be able to see where 
               they're even going.

                                     JEFF
                         Okay.  Fourteen.  Are we like, close 
                         to where we're going?  This is more 
                         work than I bargained for after a 
                         day spent looking for you.

               Eric is basically doing subconscious word association, his 
               eyes closed in the bag.

                                     ERIC
                         More work...mmkay.

                                     FINN
                         Can we...DO something about him?

                                     FOURTEEN
                         Yes.  Now is the right time.

               Fourteen throws the bag to the ground with a thud, grabs a 
               baseball bat, pummels the sleeping bag multiple times.

                                     FOURTEEN
                         That's a done.

               INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT

               A candle-lit room with some sort of solid raised table barely 
               visible in the dim light.  There's a humanoid figure 
               discernable on the table.

               Each corner of the table has a hand or foot tied to a nailed 
               stake, clearly the limbs of the person on it.

               Three figures in black robes, their faces obscured in 
               darkness, approach the table from different sides.

               The person tied to the table?  Eric.  His eyes open.

               One of the figure's hands brings a flathead screwdriver out, 
               motions it slowly over Eric's torso.

               Eric still seems pretty out of it. 

                                     ERIC
                         I'm sorry, oh look-

               The screwdriver stops above Eric's left palm.  He tries to 
               makes words. 

                                     ERIC
                         Oh shoot, my arms are connected to 
                         my hand, which is connected to my-

               The screwdriver stabs deep into the palm. 

               Eric reacts as if he's being tickled.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh god.

               The screwdriver wrenches around in there.  Eric is only a 
               tad more pained sounding, but more emphatic. 

                                     ERIC
                         Ohhh god!

               A figure by the other palm fires up an electric drill, moves 
               it toward Eric's untouched palm.

               Eric starts to recognize the gravity of all this. 

                                     ERIC
                         Ohh god!  Oh-hoh god!

               A sickening sound of drilling into flesh.  Eric's eyes bulge 
               open.

                                     ERIC
                         Someone's- Maaaaahhhh-hah-hah...ahh!

               The drill noise stops.

                                     ERIC
                         Uh-doo-hoo-hoo!

               The sound of tools being ripped out of goopy flesh.

               Eric's eyelids slowly fall closed.  There's a three-part 
               falsetto harmony, much like the one caught on camera before.  
               Then pitch darkness.

               INT. THE ROOM - LATER

               Eric's eyes open again. He's in better light than before, 
               albeit with an odd purple hue.

               The room is lit enough to see weird human-like statues by 
               the walls, and a black and white checkered floor pattern.

               Eric is still tied to the table, his hands filthy with blood.  
               Eric eyes his hands with concern.

               Jeff walks up to the table.

               Finn walks in, joins Jeff.

               Eric cocks his head toward his right palm so that they'll 
               see. 

                                     ERIC
                         Check out this.

               His right palm looks gruesome.

               Jeff and Finn remain stone-faced. 

               Eric looks past them to the open door they entered from.  
               There's a weird purple light from beyond the door.  Eric 
               mutters and trails off: 

                                     ERIC
                         Is that light on or is...?

               Jeff reaches into the bloody wound of Eric's right palm. 

               Eric makes distressed, nasally noises: 

                                     ERIC
                         Ahhh-hahah...Ahhahah..oh god...

               Jeff pulls his hand away,

               The wound is gone, but there are souffle remnants all over 
               the hand. 

               Eric looks to the palm, makes a high-pitched noise of 
               surprise: 

                                     ERIC
                         Naaa-aaaa!

               Finn puts a hand on Jeff's shoulder.

                                     FINN
                         Let's go get him.

               Jeff nods.  They head towards the purple door, disappear 
               into the light.  Finn can be barely heard still:

                                     FINN
                         Just sit tight, Eric.

               Eric squints at the purple door room. 

                                     ERIC
                         Our dialogue is waaaay too far apart.

               There's no response from the purple room.  A few moments 
               pass.  A horrible droning noise appears, grows in volume.

               Eric winces, shut his eyes as it becomes quite loud.  The 
               noise stops.  He opens his eyes.

               A sledgehammer head hurtles toward his skull, meets it with 
               a sound of sledge on metal.

               The sledge pulls back away.  Eric is somehow unscathed.  He 
               is nigh hysterical, caught between screams of terror and 
               manic laughter. 

                                     ERIC
                         Ohhh-hah-ha!  Aaahahah!  Ahhhh-hah!  
                         Hah!  Hahaha!  That was TERRIFYING!

               The sledgehammer is held by the purple man.  He scowls at 
               Eric.

                                     PURPLE
                         Allow me to explain why we've brought 
                         you here.  It's going to take a while, 
                         I'm afraid.  It involves-

               Eric interrupts, wildly insolent given the circumstances:

                                     ERIC
                         You got two minutes.

               Jeff and Finn stand beside the purple man, blunt objects in 
               hand.  Jeff quickly raises a golf club, swings it hard down 
               on Eric's shin.

               Eric reacts with appropriate painfulness for once. 

                                     ERIC
                         Fuckin' A!  What are you DOING?!

                                     FINN
                         Shut up, Eric!  You have no idea 
                         what's at stake.

               Purple glowers with fury.  He speaks menacingly but coolly.

                                     PURPLE
                         Short of time, are we?  Fine, we'll 
                         skip the explanations.  Let's get 
                         right to the task at hand, hm?  Let 
                         me ask you just one thing before we 
                         begin.  You care about the future, 
                         right, son?  Surely you hope, as we 
                         all do, for a bright future ahead of 
                         us, hm?

               Eric nods.

               Purple puts on a cheerful facade, but is still menacing 
               beneath it.

                                     PURPLE
                         Wonderful!  Then you'll have no 
                         objections to what we're about to 
                         do.  Remember my little joke from 
                         before?  I'll be doing something 
                         just like that, one more time, 
                         alright?  Nothing bad happened last 
                         time, right?

               Eric hesitates, nods again.

                                     PURPLE
                         Wooonderful!

               Purple acknowledges Finn and Jeff.

                                     PURPLE
                         What a fine fellow you've brought to 
                         me, gentlemen!

               Eric pats Eric's shoulder. 

                                     FINN
                         Good job, Eric.

                                     ERIC
                         Thanks.

                                     FINN
                         ...First good thing you done.

               Purple suddenly swings the sledgehammer at Eric's skull again.  
               This time, a horrendous smack of sledge through skull.  An 
               explosion of brain and blood everywhere.  It's silent for a 
               moment.

               Jeff and Finn proceed to smash Eric's torso and limbs over 
               and over again with blunt objects, spattering more blood and 
               guts every which way.

               Their clothes and the room get bloodier and filthier with 
               each swing.

               Purple takes a bat and gets in on the blood-soaked smashing.

               The human-like statues around the room get sprayed. 

               The guys are drenched in gore.  They keep going, relentless.

               On the table, what's left could hardly be recognized as 
               formerly a human form, yet objects keep smashing into it.

               They smash and smash, but the pace slows.  They lose momentum.  
               One final smash from purple and they lower their instruments, 
               breathe heavily.

               Finn wipes his brow.

                                     FINN
                         Is that a done?

                                     PURPLE
                         For the time being.

               Jeff approaches the heap of guts left on the table, lets 
               fall his bat, pushes the guts all into one compressed pile. 

               Finn licks his lips, rubs his belly.

               Jeff moves his arms away from the pile he compressed, but 
               the pile is...a perfectly baked souffle.

                                     JEFF
                         Bon appetit.

               They surround the souffle on the table, dig their paws into 
               it, shovel souffle into their gullets, make ravenous eating 
               noises.

               Their mouths are sloppy with souffle as they vigorously shovel 
               it in.

               Finn begins to change as he chows...he takes on a reddish 
               glow.

               Jeff takes on a blue hue, keeps eating.

               Purple has a vaguely silver aura around his purpleness.

               Finn is fully red, done eating.

               Jeff is fully blue, also done.

               Purple nods with a creepy grin, finishes one last morsel.

               The table is perfectly clean and empty.

               Finn speaks in an uncanny, stilted manner. 

                                     FINN
                         I am red man.  I makes it rain.

               Jeff speaks likewise.

                                     JEFF
                         I am blue man.  Everything is blue 
                         for my group.

               Purple beams with satisfaction, but it's very unsettling. 

                                     PURPLE
                         My boys are saved.  The future has 
                         come.

               They all whip their dicks out, waggle them around, and do 
               the three-part falsetto harmony.

               CUT TO BLACK
